# odin-landing-page

The Odin Project Foundations Landing Page Project

In this project the focus was to copy the design of the image that was provided in the assignment (Can be viewed in the images folder). There for no focus was placed on the website being responsive. Also, the intent was never to have a pixel perfect copy, the main focus was to practice css, mainly flex-box.
